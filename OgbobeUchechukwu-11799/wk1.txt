Software engineering is the systematic process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications. 
It applies engineering principles to software creation, ensuring that programs are reliable, efficient, and meet user needs. 
Unlike simple programming, software engineering focuses on the entire lifecycle of a software product.
Software engineers work in teams to define requirements, design system architecture, write code, and test functionality. 
They also emphasize documentation, version control, and project management to ensure collaboration and long-term maintenance.
